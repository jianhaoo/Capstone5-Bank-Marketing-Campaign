# Capstone5-Bank-Marketing-Campaign
Purpose Of Project

The purpose of this project is to identify the effectiveness of the marketing campaign launched by the Portuguese Bank for getting their customers to subscribe for term deposits.  As an analyst of the bank, analysis of the marketing campaign data is done and several ML models are created to predict the probability of whether a customer will subscribe for term deposits. In addition, insights and recommendations will be provided to the sales team to target on the specific group of customers to increase the subscription rate.

<b>Data Source</b>
For this project, the data source is from Kaggle.

As from the chart above, we can see a huge imbalanced of data between the number of customers who has not subscribed for the term deposits(majority) vs those who have subscribed(minority). Hence, SMOTE is being used here to create the synthetic data from the minority class.
